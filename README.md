# COT5615 - Mathematics for Intelligent Systems - Course Notes and Solutions

This repository contains comprehensive notes and solutions for the Mathematics for Intelligent Systems (COT5615) course being taught at the University of Florida under professor Kejun Huang.

These notes and solutions are what I have written during my course work and they may include errors. This is just a place for me to keep track of all my material and also put it out so that it may help others.
